	Set of scripts to analyse documents

## Folder Structure
- data 
	Source data (e.g. diagnostics and reports)
- incubator
	samples and features in progress, not fully complete
-lib
   binary tools and libraries not installed via pip or conda e.g. docto.exe
-output
    Outputs from the various scripts
- scripts
	Scripts and tests (documented below)
- web
	web application to display the analysis generated by the scripts
- . (main folder)
	everything else - including output


## SCRIPTS
All scripts will give an example of their usage when called without parameters

1. smart_extract_text.py 
	- Convert documents (pdf, ppt, doc, docx, xls etc) in folder to text. 
	- sample usage: python .\smart_text.py smr
	- output - text file version of document, in the same folder as the origial document

2. smart_generate_meta_data.py 
	- Extract meta data from a collection of text files (e.g. Dictionary for Gensim, New words not already in knowledgebase).
	- sample usage: python smart_generate_meta_data.py .\table_word_knowledge.xlsx smr output
	- outputs dictonary of new keywords not in the word knowledebase
	- outputs a cached gensim corpus object
	- outputs a cahced gensim dictionary object
	- Depends on output from  1)
	- Depends on word_knowledge.xlsx for existing knowledge

3. smart_analyse_file_keyword.py 
	- extraction of keywords from text docs
	- sample usage:  python .\quick_smart.py .\table_word_knowledge.xlsx smr output.csv
	- output is csv file with filename, keyword, number of times in doc
	- sample usage:  python .\quick_smart.py .\table_word_knowledge.xlsx smr output.csv
	- Depends on text files from 1), 
	- Used by: SMaRt.xlsx as basis for it's real time info


4. smart_analyse_gensim_topics.py 
	- perform LDA and LSA topics to provide base analysis for
	a) 
	- sample usage:  python .\quick_smart.py .\table_word_knowledge.xlsx smr output.csv
	- output is csv file with filename, keyword, number of times in doc
	- sample usage:  python .\quick_smart.py .\table_word_knowledge.xlsx smr output.csv
	- Depends on text files from 1), 
	- Used by: web application to show analsyis
    - ** work in progress **

5. smart_analyse_cosine_similarity


## FILES

**input files**
All scripts operate on text file as input, with the exception on smart_text.py, which extracts the text from files of another format


**existing files**
- table word_knowledge.xlsx 
	- what we know about specific keywords that are significant in sales and marketing
	- format
		-keyword
		- stoplist (should we strip out) e.g. common words like if, then en etc
		- mapping
		- country (is this a country - y/n)
		- highlight - should we show on filtering?
		- hex - which hex would this score into?

- SMaRt_Report.xlsx
	- displays the output of keyword / file analysis
	- Depends on output from 3
	- fomrat filename,keyword,keyword(repeated makes for easier pivot table), count

**files Created** 
- .txt files, text version of input doc, pdf, ppt etc
- output2.dict - dictionary of words from input text files
- output.corpus - corpus document
- output.new_words.csv - new words that we haven't see before (i.e. not in table_word_knowledge.xlsx)
